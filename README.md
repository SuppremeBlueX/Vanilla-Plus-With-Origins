# Vanilla-Plus With Origins
 SuppremeBlueX's Modpack

This is a Vanilla+ modpack that also adds origins. This modpack is similar to BetterMC, but with some differences and tweaks. The main difference is the origins mod, and the modpack comes with a custom datapack and resource pack to better integrate these origins into the game. These origins are custom, more powerful than 'vanilla' origins on average, and come with all sorts of unique abilities. These origins will make gameplay far more interesting, but if you get sick of your origin, there is a recipe for the orb of origin, but this recipe is expensive. This modpack also contains mods for animations, sounds, and more!
