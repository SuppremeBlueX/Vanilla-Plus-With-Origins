# Vanilla-Plus With Origins
 SuppremeBlueX's Modpack

This is a Vanilla+ modpack that also adds origins. This modpack is meant to be a vanilla+ experience similar to BetterMC, but with some differences and tweaks. The main difference is the origins mod, and this modpack comes with a custom datapack and a resource pack to better integrate these origins into the game. These origins are custom, more powerful than 'vanilla' origins on average, and come with all sorts of unique abilities. These origins will make gameplay far more interesting, but if you get sick of your origin, there is a recipe for the orb of origin, but this recipe is expensive.

The Custom Datapack should come with the modpack, but if it doesn't, it can be downloaded at https://github.com/SuppremeBlueX/Minecraft_Custom_Origins_Datapack and put into your individual worlds/server.
